title: Activating your License

After installing Telerik Test Studio, you will be asked to activate your license. During this process, your machine creates its own unique key and provides it to our server. We use this key to generate a unique license key for the installation of the product. This article discusses how to go through this process and provides a guided walk-through. All users, both trial and purchased, will need to activate their product after installation before they can begin using the tool.
